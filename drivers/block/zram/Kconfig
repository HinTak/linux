	  Creates virtual block devices called /dev/zramX (X = 0, 1, ...).
	  Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored in memory
	  itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
	  good amounts of memory savings.

	  It has several use cases, for example: /tmp storage, use as swap
	  disks and maybe many more.

	  See zram.txt for more information.

      A special purpose allocator for storing compressed pages.
      It is designed to store up to three compressed pages per physical
      page. It is a ZBUD derivative so the simplicity and determinism are
      still there.
