config SMART_DEADLOCK
	bool "Smart Deadlock Detecting Framwork"
	default n
	help
	This frame-work is for detecting watchdog system of TizenTV(systemd/ANR)
	If there is deadlock problem in TizenTV, it is very difficult to define
	the reason. So this feature will just report whenever deadlock occurs in
	any service.This feature is for only TizenTV system.

config SMART_DEADLOCK_PROFILE_MODE
	bool "Smart Deadlock Profile Mode"
	default n
	depends on SMART_DEADLOCK
	depends on KDEBUGD
	help
	This option will enable profiling in smart deadlock framework. It means that
	now deadlock detector framework will also collect backtrace information of the
	processes. Now whenever deadlock occurs in any service, then deadlock detector
	framework will also store the backtrace information of the deadlock process in
	a file using dlog.

config SMART_DEADLOCK_ALL_THREAD_BACKTRACE
        bool "Smart Deadlock All Thread Backtrace"
        default n
        depends on SMART_DEADLOCK_PROFILE_MODE
        help
        This option will enable printing of all thread backtrace when deadlock is
	declared on a process waiting in pthread_cond_wait.

config SMART_DEADLOCK_DELAY_LAUNCH_LLDB
	bool "Smart Deadlock Delay Launch LLDB"
	default n
	depends on SMART_DEADLOCK_PROFILE_MODE
	help
